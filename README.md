# Dynamic Programming Exercises
## Description

This repository includes a Jupyter notebook with some dynamic programming exercises implemented in Python.
You can view the code [here](https://github.com/Konfuzian/dynamic-programming-exercises/blob/main/Dynamic%20Programming%20Exercises.ipynb) or install it on your computer as described below.

For every exercise, there is a non-optimized "basic" version and two faster versions, one with memoization and one with tabulation.

The code exercises are based on this [Youtube lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk) by freeCodeCamp.org.


## Installation

_You will probably want to create a virtual environment before running this._

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook "Dynamic Programming Exercises.ipynb"
```
